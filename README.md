# flask_react_template
Application template for a Flask&lt;>React app w/ TailwindCSS

Basically I got tired of setting up all of this boilerplate everytime I wanted to launch a new project with Flask, React, and TailwindCSS. 

Hopefully you also find it to be a better starting place than a completely empty repo.
